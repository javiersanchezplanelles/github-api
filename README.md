# github-api
For this project I used vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. 
I used the built-in XMLHttpRequest object to request data, specifically to communicate with Github's API.
I made two calls: one to get the user's info and another one to get a list of their repositories.
I parsed the JSON object and then was able to work with that data and output it on the document.
I decided against using JavaScript's 'fetch' as it's not IE11 compatible.
